# Foundations-and-Fundamentals
A space to put documents for the foundations and fundamentals of UQ at the INI.

## BASICS

### Key concepts - what is uncertainty?  what is error?

Any key papers? Perhaps needs a discussion rather than a paper dump?

### Key methods - Gaussian Processes, Stochastic Collocation, Stochastic Galerkin

I can recommend a tour through [Catherine Powell's Lecture Notes](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~cp/MATH20411.html) for those who haven't done applied mathematics since undergrad days and those who would like a refresher.

For an overview of Bayesian analysis of computer codes I believe [Tony O'Hagan's introduction](www.tonyohagan.co.uk/academic/pdf/BACCO-tutorial.pdf) is a good start.

[Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/) is available in pdf format to download.  This book covers a lot of the relevant material. 

I have used the R package [DiceKriging](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DiceKriging/index.html) for my projects and those with any interest in building an emulator could start here following the accompanying text [DiceKriging, DiceOptim: Two R Packages for the Analysis of Computer Experiments by Kriging-Based Metamodeling and Optimization](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v051i01/v51i01.pdf).  The first two authors of the paper will be programme visitors at various times.  

### Key problems and examples



## Functional analysis

### Infinite v finite dimension

Key texts here appear in [Hermann Matthies' seminar](http://www.newton.ac.uk/seminar/20180117110013002). 

## Model discrepancy

The statisticians have referred a lot to [Kennedy & O'Hagan 2001](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9868.00294/abstract) as the core concept text.  I don't think there is a successful application of this work and research is ongoing to apply it.  

Other key texts on model discrepancy appear with regards to [history matching](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ba/1340110846) - although this isn't the seminal article it contains some information on Bayes Linear modelling as well as some nice text regarding our definitions of model uncertainties.


### Extrapolation of the discrepancy

### Reification

Michael Goldstein and Jonty Rougier have written the theory for [model reification](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378375808003303?via%3Dihub) in which one models coherent assessment of the model deficiencies. 

## Decision Theory

### Why we do UQ? and How does UQ help in the real world?


## Conditioning and Updating

### Bayesian surprises
